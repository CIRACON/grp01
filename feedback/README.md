# Overview

Create a React web application to allow employees to give feedback or questions anonymously to their managers. The system should allow employees to self-register. The system should recognize which employees are managers and who their direct reports are. Employees should be able to ask a question or give feedback and when their manager logs in they should see that feedback and be able to respond. Upon login employees should see responses.
